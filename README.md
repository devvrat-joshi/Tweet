## Client and Server Side Logic
### Server Side Logic
- Server is a multi-threaded concurrent server, which can handle around 4500 queries per minute.
- Whenever server receives a query, it checks the first word of the query.
- The server creates a new thread per query.
- The first word is the command which client is asking the server to execute.
- Server will look into the dictionary of commands and if the command is present in the list, then there will be an entry of a function corresponding to that command.
- Server will run that function and pass the data from the client as argument.
- The state maintanance and database design is under the topic, HLD, LLD.

### Client Side Logic

- When client program starts, it sends to server a command named "init".
- Server will return a token number to that client which will be stored by client for the future use.
- For every input command from the user, client opens a TCP connection with the server and also sends this token number so that the server can maintain a state of this particular client.
- The client program also starts a server on its side, so that if the main server receives a chat message that is to be send to the client, then it can connect to the server at client side.
- Client program gives an input for the user, from where user can enter all the commands that are to be executed by the server.
- First the user has to enter the credentials and then the server will map the token number of that client to the username of that client after authentication is successful.
- If a tweet is to be sent, then client program will open nano editor.
- User types the tweet in this editor and after pressing "Y", the tweet will be posted with the credentials of client.
