## Client and Server Side Logic
### Server Side Logic
- Server is a multi-threaded concurrent server, which can handle around 4500 queries per minute.
- Whenever server receives a query, it checks the first word of the query.
- The server creates a new thread per query.
- The first word is the command which client is asking the server to execute.
- Server will look into the dictionary of commands and if the command is present in the list, then there will be an entry of a function corresponding to that command.
- Server will run that function and pass the data from the client as argument.
- The state maintanance and database design is under the topic, HLD, LLD.

### Client Side Logic

- When client program starts, it sends to server a command named "init".
- Server will return a token number to that client which will be stored by client for the future use.
- For every input command from the user, client opens a TCP connection with the server and also sends this token number so that the server can maintain a state of this particular client.
- The client program also starts a server on its side, so that if the main server receives a chat message that is to be send to the client, then it can connect to the server at client side.
- Client program gives an input for the user, from where user can enter all the commands that are to be executed by the server.
- First the user has to enter the credentials and then the server will map the token number of that client to the username of that client after authentication is successful.
- If a tweet is to be sent, then client program will open nano editor.
- User types the tweet in this editor and after pressing "Y", the tweet will be posted with the credentials of client.



## State Management

- Client sends init command to server whenever client program starts running.
- Server will return a unique token number to client.
- When client sends the login/register credentials, the server will map the logged in client username to the token number that was assigned before to the client program.
- At the time of sending the credentials, the client program also appended the token id which was given by the server at the time of starting the client program.
- For every subsequent query, the client will send the token number appended with the query.
- If no username is mapped to that token id, then server will ask to authenticate and then only the user can ask for data.
- There is sqlite3 database on the server side which has several tables, eg. tweets_table, users_table, followers_table, updates_table, etc.
- The information related to the client is stored in this database.
- Accessing the personal data requires login.
- This is how, server maintains state of every client.

## Security Aspects
- For user specific commands, the user should be first logged in from the client program.
- Otherwise the features cannot be accessed.
- The authentication process is explained in state management section.
- Apart from trending, profile viewing, every other query requires that the user is authenticated.
- When user types the password, it is obsured and is not shown on screen.


## Design

### Database Structure

![](https://i.imgur.com/FldgbA8.png)

### Users Table
- username - Username of the user
- password - Password of the user
- followers - Number of followers
- following - Number of following
- is_online - Is online or not

Users table contains information related to the user, such as username, password, number of followers and number of following.

### Followers Table

- follower - Follower username
- followed - The username of person who is being followed.

The actual data of who is following whom is stored in this table.

### Tweets Table

- tweet_id - unique tweet number given by database
- username - username who has tweeted the tweet
- body of the tweet
- created_at - time of creation of tweet

All the tweets are stored in this table with each tweet having its unique id.

### Pins Table

- id - unique id given to pinned tweets
- username - the user who is pinning his tweets
- tweet_id - Id of the own tweet, which is to be pinned. This id should be of a tweet which is created by the username.

If a user pins a tweet on his/her profile, then this table will store the tweet_id and username for getting the pinned tweets corresponsing to a user.

### Tags Table

- id - unique id given to a tag corresponding to a tweet
- tag - the name of tag
- tweet_id - Id of the tweet which has this hashtag.

Tags table stores the tag name and the id of the tweet which contains the tag. This id helps to find the tweets corresponding to a particular tag name if someone asks for tweets with filter as a hashtag.

### Updates

- update_id - unique ID of a update
- username - username whose update is being stored
- body - body of the update. 
- created_at - Time at which the update was created by the server
- is_read - update read or not by the user

This table stores the updates of all users. These updates are notifications like, someone mentioned you in the tweet, someone retweeted your tweet, etc. The table is updated as soon as someone posts a tweet or something related to the user.

### Group Table
- group_id - Unique id of the group
- groupname - groupname at the time of creation of group.
- members - number of members in the group (Dynamic variable)

This table stores information about all the groups and the number of members in the group.

### Group Members Table

- group_id - Unique id of the group.
- groupname - groupname at the time of creation of group
- username - username of the owner/group creator

This table stores information about all the groups members corresponding to different groups. Only the group owner can add or remove members from the group. The group owner can also delete the group.
