# Client and Server Side Logic
## Server Side Logic
- Server is a multi-threaded concurrent server, which can handle around 4500 queries per minute.
- Whenever server receives a query, it checks the first word of the query.
- The server creates a new thread per query.
- The first word is the command which client is asking the server to execute.
- Server will look into the dictionary of commands and if the command is present in the list, then there will be an entry of a function corresponding to that command.
- Server will run that function and pass the data from the client as argument.
- The state maintanance and database design is under the topic, HLD, LLD.

## Client Side Logic

- When client program starts, it sends to server a command named "init".
- Server will return a token number to that client which will be stored by client for the future use.
- For every input command from the user, client opens a TCP connection with the server and also sends this token number so that the server can maintain a state of this particular client.
- The client program also starts a server on its side, so that if the main server receives a chat message that is to be send to the client, then it can connect to the server at client side.
- Client program gives an input for the user, from where user can enter all the commands that are to be executed by the server.
- First the user has to enter the credentials and then the server will map the token number of that client to the username of that client after authentication is successful.
- If a tweet is to be sent, then client program will open nano editor.
- User types the tweet in this editor and after pressing "Y", the tweet will be posted with the credentials of client.



# State Management

- Client sends init command to server whenever client program starts running.
- Server will return a unique token number to client.
- When client sends the login/register credentials, the server will map the logged in client username to the token number that was assigned before to the client program.
- At the time of sending the credentials, the client program also appended the token id which was given by the server at the time of starting the client program.
- For every subsequent query, the client will send the token number appended with the query.
- If no username is mapped to that token id, then server will ask to authenticate and then only the user can ask for data.
- There is sqlite3 database on the server side which has several tables, eg. tweets_table, users_table, followers_table, updates_table, etc.
- The information related to the client is stored in this database.
- Accessing the personal data requires login.
- This is how, server maintains state of every client.

# Security Aspects
- For user specific commands, the user should be first logged in from the client program.
- Otherwise the features cannot be accessed.
- The authentication process is explained in state management section.
- Apart from trending, profile viewing, every other query requires that the user is authenticated.
- When user types the password, it is obsured and is not shown on screen.


# Design

- The topology is a single topology
- There are 11 clients and the types of the workload queries for client is given below.

### Type 1 Clients
- These are the clients which queries for the commands which does not require login.
- Client 1,2,3 in the test script have 10000 such queries per client.
- Queries are given below
1. search ```<regex>```
2. profile ```<username>```
3. trending
4. hashtag

### Type 2 Clients
- These clients login with a particular username which is already registered.
- Then they generate tweets with the help of lorem library.
- After tweets are generated, random words in the tweets are assigned the "#" tags.
- Some tags which are meant to be trended are also included in these tweets.
- Client 4,5 are these clients in the tests scripts.
1. Tweet intensive

### Type 3 Clients
- These are the clients which asks for updates and feed and do some tweets.
- Client 6,7 are these clients in the tests scripts.
1. Updates
2. Tweet
3. Feed intensive process.

### Type 4 Clients
- These are the clients which register a user, then do some retweets of tweets by the users of other clients.
- After that they logout and again register a new user and follow this loop for 200 times.
- Client 8,9 are these clients in the tests scripts.
1. Register 200 users and then retweet

### Type 5 Clients
- These are the clients which chat with other clients.
- Client 10,11 are these clients in the tests scripts.
1. Chat with each other

## Server Performance
- Tweets are limited to 200 characters. There is also some limit in twitter for tweet size.

## Number of Queries served by the server.
- After running ```make``` command, a real time update of the number and names of the queries answered by the server is shown on the terminal.
- The time is shown on the top right corner. Counting the time was started when the server started.
